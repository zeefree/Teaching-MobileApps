# Image Editor
This is my attempt at a simiple Image Editor for our second Mobile App project. In it the user can either use a picture from the gallery or take a new picture to edit. 


## System Design 
Tested on an Android 7 device, though should worn on system 5 through 8.

## Usage
At the beginning you can choose to take a picture or upload a picture to use a few sample image manipulations on. The image manipulations are on a horizontal scroll so feel free to scroll and take a look. Keep in mind that effects can be chained together but as of yet there is no way to undo an effect so effects are thus, in a sense, final. You can still click on buttons besides the picture buttons but they will not do anything for you. At the bottom of the screen is a button to clear the image (feel free to scroll down to use it) It is not necessary to clear the image before loading a new one. As of yet, the upload to gallery button doesn't actually save the image to your pictures.
